- Countries that have GDP lower than 50B but have high sales indicate a unique market affinity for MYSELLAR's offerings.
  
Further investigation into market conditions, customer preferences, and competitive positioning, in identified underperforming countries is recommended to leverage ecomnomic productivity for increased sales.
